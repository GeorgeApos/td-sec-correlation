# Technical Debt and Software Security Correlation Analysis

## Repository Overview
This repository contains a detailed analysis of the intricate dynamics between **Technical Debt (TD)** and **Software Security** within open-source projects. The research delves into how technical debt influences security risks and vulnerabilities in large and complex codebases.

### Files Included
- **project-level-experiments.ipynb**: Contains experiments and analysis focusing on project-level insights.
- **file-level-experiments.ipynb**: Provides insights on file-level metrics and their impact on security.
- **time-series-experiments.ipynb**: Explores time-series analysis for tracking the evolution of technical debt and security over time.

## Usage
Each Jupyter Notebook provides a series of experiments and analyses. You can run them to explore different facets of technical debt and security in open-source projects.

## Acknowledgements
This analysis is part of a broader study exploring the relationship between software quality attributes and security in software systems.
